## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 💵 DSC (Decentralized StableCoin)
An ERC20 token designed to track **$1.00**, backed by more value in collateral than is minted. Think of it as a crypto-backed dollar that you can mint by locking up valuable assets.

### 🏦 Collateral (WETH / WBTC)
You lock WETH or WBTC into the `DSCEngine` contract. This collateral is valued in real-time via **Chainlink price feeds**, ensuring accurate USD valuations.

### ❤️ Health Factor
A critical metric that tells you how safe your position is:
- **> 1.0** → ✅ Safe position
- **≤ 1.0** → ⚠️ Can be liquidated

**Formula:** `(Total Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Total DSC Debt`

### 🪙 Minting DSC
You can mint DSC tokens against your collateral, but only if your **health factor stays above the minimum threshold**. The more collateral you have, the more DSC you can mint safely.

### 🔄 Redeeming / Burning
- **Redeem Collateral**: Return (burn) DSC → receive your WETH / WBTC back
- **Burn DSC**: Reduces your debt and improves your health factor

### ⚡ Liquidation
If someone's health factor drops too low, another user can **liquidate** their position, repaying their DSC debt and taking a portion of their collateral with a bonus.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- 📦 **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- 🔧 **Foundry** ([Installation Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation))
- 🦊 **MetaMask** browser extension
- 🌐 **Sepolia RPC URL** (for testnet deployment) – Get one from [Infura](https://infura.io) or [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com)

### 1️⃣ Install Foundry

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Foundry dependencies
forge install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3️⃣ Deploy Contracts

#### 🏠 Local Development (Anvil)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Anvil
anvil

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
forge script script/DeployAndUpdateFrontend.s.sol:DeployAndUpdateFrontend \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --broadcast
```

#### 🌐 Sepolia Testnet

```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key

# Deploy
./deploy-sepolia.sh
```

The deployment script will print contract addresses in this format:

```env
VITE_DSC_ENGINE_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_DSC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_WETH_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_WBTC_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Frontend

Create `frontend/.env` with the addresses from deployment:

```env
VITE_DSC_ENGINE_ADDRESS=0xYourEngineAddress
VITE_DSC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xYourDSCAddress
VITE_WETH_ADDRESS=0xYourWETHAddress
VITE_WBTC_ADDRESS=0xYourWBTCAddress
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_optional
```

**⚠️ Important:** No spaces around `=` signs!

### 5️⃣ Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser! 🎉

## 🎨 Frontend Features

### 🏠 Landing Page (Disconnected State)

When you first visit RaveCoin, you're greeted by a stunning landing page:

- ⚡ **Animated Hero** – RaveCoin logo at the center of three orbiting rings, creating an "endless timepiece" effect
- 📊 **Live Market Ticker** – Continuously scrolling prices for BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, LINK, and ARB with real-time data from CoinGecko
- 💫 **Silver Meteor Effects** – Subtle animated streaks in key sections
- 📖 **Protocol Overview** – Clear explanations of features, use cases, and how it works
- 🔗 **Seamless Connection** – One-click wallet connection that instantly transitions to the dashboard

### 💼 Dashboard (Connected State)

Once connected, you get access to a comprehensive dashboard:

#### 📊 Account Overview
- **Health Factor** – Color-coded indicator (green = safe, red = risky)
- **Total Collateral Value** – USD value of all deposited collateral
- **DSC Minted** – Your current stablecoin debt

#### 💰 Collateral Positions
For each token (WETH / WBTC):
- Deposited amount
- Wallet balance
- Token symbol & address

#### 🎯 Actions Available
- **Deposit** – Lock WETH or WBTC as collateral
- **Mint DSC** – Create stablecoins against your collateral
- **Redeem** – Withdraw collateral by burning DSC
- **Burn DSC** – Reduce debt to improve health factor
- **Liquidate** – Close undercollateralized positions (with bonus!)

### 🔒 Transaction Verifier (NEW! 🎉)

A **premium security feature** that analyzes MetaMask transactions before you sign them:

- 🔍 **AI-Powered Analysis** – Uses OpenAI GPT to detect malicious patterns
- 🛡️ **Risk Assessment** – Get risk levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Safe)
- 📋 **Function Selector Analysis** – Examines the first 4 bytes of calldata
- 💡 **Heuristic Fallback** – Works even without an API key
- ⚡ **Transaction Hash Support** – Paste a hash or raw calldata

**How to Use:**
1. Click the **"Verify TX"** button in the navigation bar
2. Paste a transaction hash (from Etherscan) or raw calldata
3. Get instant risk analysis and recommendations
4. Make informed decisions before signing!

**Setup (Optional):**
Add `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `frontend/.env` for enhanced AI analysis. Without it, the verifier uses heuristic analysis.

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**🔴 Frontend not updating?**
- Restart `npm run dev` after changing `.env`
- Clear browser cache
- Check that addresses in `.env` match deployment output

**🔴 MetaMask auto-connecting wrong account?**
1. Use MetaMask "Connected sites" to disconnect
2. Click **Disconnect** button in the app
3. Reconnect – the app forces account selection

**🔴 Transaction failing?**
- Check your health factor (must stay above 1.0)
- Ensure you have enough collateral
- Verify you're on the correct network (Sepolia or local)

**🔴 Dropdown not visible?**
- The select dropdown should now have proper dark styling
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

### Development Tips

- 🧪 **Testing**: Run `forge test` to execute all smart contract tests
- 📝 **Linting**: Use `forge fmt` to format Solidity code
- 🔍 **Debugging**: Check browser console and Foundry logs
- 🎨 **Styling**: Main styles in `frontend/src/App.css`
